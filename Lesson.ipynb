    "What actually happens when you run code, or execute a program on a computer? If we focus on Python, what happens when we run Python code? Does our computer \"speak Python\", understand what we type, and do what we ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that no, our computer does NOT speak Python. When we execute Python code, our code is passed to an **interpreter**. This interpreter is what reads our code and translates what we have written into what is called **machine code**. Machine code is typically not human-readable. That's the reason we have languages like Python, R, C++, Java, etc. We need a way to express logic clearly and explicitly, so that it can be translated into the kind of code that our computer DOES understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, human speech (or written human language) does not translate directly to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what actually happens once we write our code, and the computer starts to run that code? We can understand the basics of this process through the following six (simplified!) steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The computer allocates memory to the program\n",
    "2) The program issues a series of instructions to the processor (the thinking part of the computer)\n",
    "3) Upon completion of one instruction by the processor, the next is started\n",
    "4) Information is returned from the processor to the program as needed\n",
    "5) New instructions are sent to the processor based on information received from the processor\n",
    "6) Return to step 2, repeat until program is finished\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program is running, it typically has a single space in memory in which it stores all information relevant to its task. This memory space allows the information to be used by whichever part of the program requires that information to use it. Basically, think of all of the things in memory as shared assets, and different parts of the program want to be able to access them at the same time. Kind of like if you share a storage space with a friend or family member. Sometimes you'll be pulling out the camping gear, and sometimes they will be instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information that is accessible across the entire program are called **globally defined values**. But not all variables are global. Some variables with reduced **scope** are not available to all segments of a program. You might have valuables that you don't share with the other people using your storage space. It's kind of like that. Variables with reduced scope are only available to parts of the program that share that scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "While for people, we restrict access primarily based on keeping valuables safe, programs tend to do it in order to ensure that information is not lost or modified while it is needed by a part of the program. You wouldn't want to have someone change your budgeting spreadsheet in the middle of the month, would you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, **scope** is a term used to define the areas in which a given value in memory is accessible. Variables that are **Global** in scope can typically be accessed by any function or command running as part of the program. Variables that are **Local** can only be accessed within the scope in which they are defined. A variable created inside a function is said to be **local** to that function, and only available until the function is concluded. Then it is either returned to the global space, or forgotten.\n"

    "One of the single biggest changes in computational technology in the recent past was the advent and spread of parallel computation. This concept is the crux of this lesson, but needs a lot of explaining, because it isn't something that we as computer USERS have to deal with. It happens behind the scenes, despite its tremendous importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential programs\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform tasks, some steps must be performed sequentially. This happens because one task depends on the results of the other task. For example, an American football team will only make a play on fourth down if they fail to score or convert on third down. We can't fully implement our plan for fourth down until we have seen whether or not fourth down will occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to aim our penalty shot in FIFA before taking the kick. We even need to wait to complete the details for the elimination rounds of the tournament until group play has ended. Until then, we don't know enough about which teams will advance to complete the bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming speak, sequential programs are sequential because it is critical that the results of one calculation be within the **scope** of the other calculations. If one sequential calculation cannot view the results of the prior calculation, then the second function cannot be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some calculations can be performed independent of the results of other steps. These tend to be calculations that can essentially be considered separate tasks, but part of a larger overall task. Some examples include\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch processing of files\n",
    "- Non-sequential simulations\n",
    "- Serving recommended products to many users\n",
    "- Repeated random draws\n",
    "- Rendering polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between serial and parallel programs is the dependency (or lack of dependency) of calculations on the results of previous calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serial programs rely on previous results\n",
    "- Parallel programs do not depend on the results of other calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel programs can occur simultaneously, allowing us to accelerate execution. If we can run four calculations simultaneously, then in theory we might be able to run 100 computations in the time that a serial program might run 25 similar computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel computations have enabled advances like improved graphics in video games, and have made possible the revolution in machine learning. Let's learn how to make parallel code work for our projects, as well!\n"

    "One place where parallel processing really shines is in estimating complex mathematical calculations. While some math can be solved algebraically, other math problems can only be solved computationally. The more computations we can perform in a given amount of time, the sooner we can find the solution to those problems. We can buy faster computers to speed up calculations, but we can also parallelize many calculations, giving us benefits without having to upgrade our computer!\n",

    "1) Choose points at which to estimate the value of the function\n",
    "2) Choose bandwidth\n",

    "The ``multiprocess`` library is designed to create multiple sub-instances of the python interpreter called processes, with each process returning values that are independent of the other processes. In order to coordinate this effort, some computational power must be assigned to send off processes and to retrieve their results upon completion. \n",

    "\n",
    "Given the overhead of parallelization, it is not worthwhile to make a parallel version of our single integral function above. Instead, it IS worthwhile to create a function that can calculate the integral many times in parallel. Like we said above, convergence is noisy, but an average value for each given number of bins should be more stable.\n",
